# PlantDiseaseDetectPro

ðŸŒ¿ **PlantDiseaseDetectPro** is an AI-powered web app that detects diseases in pepperbell, potato, and tomato plants from leaf images. It provides accurate disease classification along with actionable care advice to help farmers and gardeners keep their crops healthy.

---

## Features

- Upload a plant leaf image (pepperbell, potato, or tomato)
- Fast and accurate disease prediction using TensorFlow Lite model
- Supports 15 disease classes across 3 crops
- Displays disease name, confidence score, and personalized advice
- Simple React frontend with a FastAPI backend

---

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: React, Axios, CSS
- Backend: FastAPI, Python
- Model: TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) image classification
- Image processing: Pillow, NumPy

## Setup & Run Locally

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js & npm
- Git

### Backend

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd PlantDiseaseDetectPro/backend
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
   .\venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the FastAPI backend server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install npm dependencies:
